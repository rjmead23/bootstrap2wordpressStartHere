Converting Wordpress site to Dynamic

Download Wordpress from https://wordpress.org/download/
Unzip the folder, rename it to what you want it to be called as the project and put it in the htdocs folder

Download a starter theme from http://underscores.me - this is a baseline theme that is a starting point it saves time.
Put this into a folder with the name that you want - put it in the Xamp directory htdocs (will need this later)

Turn on Xamp and navigate to PHP admin
Create a new database (remember what you call it)
Create an admin user in the new database:

database name: bootstrap2wordpress2
DB_USER: bootman
DB_PASSWORD: admin

Table_prefix = 'wp_' by default - change it to something else for production sites. like dbbs_

Navigate to localhost http://localhost/FOLDERNAME/ (folder name of wordpress files not the underscores.me files) 
- Enter in the details you are asked for taken from database creation steps.
Click button to check connection to the database. Once successful - This step is creating the wp-config.php file (you could also manually update the
wp-config-sample.php file and rename it to wp-config.php file - I've had more succcess letting wordpress create it on it's own.

Now click on install which will install Wordpress.

Once installed you should be able to log into wordpress: http://localhost/b2w2/wp-admin/ - replace b2w2 with folder you have

login with user admin: Cal1f0rn1a3! - You should be taken to the Wordpress dashboard.

Install underscores theme: - Drop the underscores theme folder downloaded earlier into the Wordpress installed wp-content/themes folder.
This theme should then show up in the Wordpress Dashboard under Appearance/Themes
Activate the theme - Click on the theme and hit activate. (note there isn't an image for the theme to start with).


MAKE IT Dynamic

First go into header.php and remove the whole header section and replace it with the header section taken from the index.html file of the static site.  There is a known issue where you need to use
the class: class-wp-bootstrap-navwalker.php - which is a file you can download from my repository.



	<!-- HEADER -->
	<header class="site-header">

			<!-- NAVBAR -->
			<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-dark bg-dark fixed-top">
					<div class="container">
						<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse" aria-controls="#navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button>
						<a class="navbar-brand" href="/"><img src="<?php bloginfo('stylesheet_directory');?>/assets/img/logo.png" alt="Bootstrap to WordPress"></a>

							<?php
								wp_nav_menu( array(
									'menu' 	=> 'primary',
									'depth'						=> '2',
									'container' 			=> 'nav',
									'container_class' => 'collapse navbar-collapse',
									'menu_class'			=> 'nav navbar-nav ml-auto',
									'fallback_cb'       => 'wp_bootstrap_navwalker::fallback',
        					'walker'            => new wp_bootstrap_navwalker()

								) );

							 ?>


						</div>
			</nav>
	</header>
